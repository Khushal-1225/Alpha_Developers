        <h1>Stellar-mass black holes</h1><br>
        <p>The stellar black holes arise as a final evolution stage of massive stars. The star has to have mass at
            least ten times larger than is the mass of Sun. This guarantees that after all the nuclear fuel has been
            consumed and the star explodes and casts off outer shells, there is still enough mass in its core with
            enough gravity to collapse into a black hole. The most massive stars have masses only up to about 500 solar
            masses otherwise they are not stable. It means that the most massive black hole of stellar origin can have a
            mass of about few hundred solar masses too.</p>

        <p>Most of the stars live in pairs as binaries or in some more complicated systems. Our Sun makes quite an
            exception here because only every fifth star in our Galaxy lives on its own without a companion. Imagine a
            binary system containing two heavy stars of quite similar but still different masses. The heavier star will
            evolve slightly more rapidly and will run out of fuel sooner. When that happens, it will explode as a
            supernova and likely create a black hole from what was left from its core. The other star, assuming it has
            been able to survive the cataclysmic explosion of its sister, will soon be getting to the end of its live
            too. For a brief period of time (it is brief from the point of view of the age of the star, but it may last
            millions of years), before it explodes as a supernova too, it will grow up in size and lower its surface
            temperature. At this stage it may become large enough for its outer shells to be gravitationally attracted
            by the black hole short distance away. Material from the star's surface will star to flow onto the black
            hole. Because the two objects orbit each other, the flow of the material is not straight, but is dragged by
            non-inertial Corriolis force and forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The gas is viscously heated
            and emits electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths corresponding to its temperature on the range from
            infrared to X-rays. This is the stage, when we can discover there is a black hole there and when we can
            observe it through its accretion disk. When the second star finishes and explodes, we may end up with a
            binary black-hole system or (depending on the original mass of the stars) with a black hole and neutron star
            system or with a binary neutron star.

        <h1>Supermassive black holes</h1><br>
        <p> What we have described is just one of may possible ways how a stellar black hole may be created. That
            scenario is quite typical, but the details may differ depending on circumstances. It quite depends on masses
            of the original stars whether the system ends up as a binary black hole or a black hole and neutron star or
            as a binary neutron star. If two black holes are left, we can only learn about then with a gravitational
            wave detector. If a black hole and a neutron star are left and we are in addition lucky and the neutron star
            is a pulsar oriented towards Earth, we may detect its pulses with gradually increasing frequency, which is
            sign of a second massive component in the system. We may even be super-lucky and find a double pulsar where
            two neutron stars both become pulsars and in addition they are both oriented towards Earth so that we can
            measure pulses of both. Indeed such system were found and they serve us to indirectly confirm predictions of
            Einstein's theory of relativity.</p>

            
           <p>The supermassive black holes are substantially more massive and they are also much older. However, their
            origin is the same as the origin of stellar mass black holes. When the first stars were created from
            abundant dense clouds of hydrogen and helium in the early universe, they were heavy with masses of hundreds
            of solar mass. They also lived briefly because they burned the fuel fast and soon they turned into first
            black holes. The black holes were bigger and more numerous where the original gas cloud was heavier and
            smaller and less plentiful where the birth cloud was sparser. They acted on one another by their gravity,
            larger ones merging with smaller and growing in mass. Billions of years passed, universe had expanded, and
            the slightly larger black holes grew by continuously merging with smaller ones to enormous masses. They
            become local centers of gravity and formed whole galaxies around them. Today, we think based on good
            evidence that every galaxy holds one supermassive black holes in its very center with mass at least a
            million up to tens of billion of solar masses..</p>
